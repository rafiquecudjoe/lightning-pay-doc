## Lightning Pay Sandbox API ⚙️

To make integrations much easier, the API has a sandbox version that can be used for development.

The sandbox version allows you to build on the testnet of Bitcoin and Lightning


## Testnet and Signet

During Development on the Sandbox platform, lightning transactions are done on testnet and Onchain BTC 
transactions on Signet. These are reliable and public test networks where you can receive or send transactions
without spending actual bitcoins.

### Sandbox Transactions

Lightning invoice and Onchain Address generated during development can be paid on testnet and
Bitcoin faucetrespectively.
